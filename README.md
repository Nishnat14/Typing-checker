# Typing Game

A typing speed game designed to test and improve typing skills. This project features a countdown timer, a mistake counter, and calculations for Words Per Minute (WPM) and Characters Per Minute (CPM).

## Features

- **Random Paragraphs**: Displays random text paragraphs for typing practice.
- **WPM and CPM Calculation**: Measures typing speed in words per minute and characters per minute.
- **Mistake Tracking**: Counts typing errors and updates the mistake count in real-time.
- **Countdown Timer**: Tracks the remaining time (60 seconds) and updates WPM accordingly.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows users to start a new typing session with a "Try Again" button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the game elements and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handles game logic, including typing input, timer, and score calculations.

## How It Works

1. **Loading Paragraphs**: The game loads a random paragraph from a predefined list for the player to type.
2. **Typing Mechanics**: As the player types, the game highlights the text being typed, tracks mistakes, and updates WPM and CPM.
3. **Timer**: A countdown timer starts at 60 seconds and updates the WPM based on the time elapsed and characters typed.
4. **Reset**: The "Try Again" button resets the game, allowing the player to start over with a new paragraph and fresh statistics.
